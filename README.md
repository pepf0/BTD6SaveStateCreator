# SaveStateCreator
A little Project that I made, so that you can create and load Save States for BTD6. Can be useful in Boss Events! 

# How to create a Save State
1. Close BTD6. Once BTD6 is closed, press the "Create Save State" Button. Now the current Save State has been saved.
2. You can open and play BTD6 now. If you want to return to the Save State, just close BTD6 and press the "Load Save State" Button. 

# Extra Infos
Backups of SaveStates will always be created.
You can also see all old save states by pressing the "Old Save States" Button.
Advanced: By renaming either one of the old or backed up save states and moving them up 1 folder, then pressing the load button you can also load older save states. Only do this if you know what you're doing
