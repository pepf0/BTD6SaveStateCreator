# SaveStateCreator
A little Project that I made, so that you can create and load Save States for BTD6. Can be useful in Boss Events! 

# How to create a Save State
1. Go to the BTD6 Main Menu. Then press the "Create Save State" Button and name your save whatever you want. Now the current Save State has been saved.
2. If you want to return to a Save State, just close BTD6 and press the "Load Save State" Button, then select the save you want to load.
3. If you wanna Rename or Delete Saves, just press on "Manage Save States"
